#beacon test:


Ir is a really simple code that start, publish some info as a beacon then, go in deep sleep mode. After some confiugrable ms, it awakes and restart. Simple but effective. 

To use it: get arduino ide. 

To compile this file you will need arduino and esp library. 
Insert in Preference Settings: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json 

To install: you need to link your esp32 with your pc with a configured arduino ide. The compile and load. If everything is ok, you can see publish the info as bluetooth beacon. To check and verify I use nrfconnect android app.
